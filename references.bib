                   important task that helps to understand time series and can
                   enable better forecasting. Nowadays, with high sampling rates
                   leading to high-frequency data (such as daily, hourly, or
                   minutely data), many real-world datasets contain time series
                   data that can exhibit multiple seasonal patterns. Although
                   several methods have been proposed to decompose time series
                   better under these circumstances, they are often
                   computationally inefficient or inaccurate. In this study, we
                   propose Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess
                   (MSTL), an extension to the traditional Seasonal-Trend
                   decomposition using Loess (STL) procedure, allowing the
                   decomposition of time series with multiple seasonal patterns.

                   time series dataset, compared to other decomposition
                   benchmarks, MSTL demonstrates competitive results with lower
                   computational cost. The implementation of MSTL is available

  abstract      = "Forecast reconciliation of multivariate time series is the
                   process of mapping a set of incoherent forecasts into
                   coherent forecasts to satisfy a given set of linear
                   constraints. Commonly used projection matrix based approaches
                   for point forecast reconciliation are OLS (ordinary least
                   squares), WLS (weighted least squares), and MinT (minimum
                   trace). Even though point forecast reconciliation is a
                   well-established field of research, the literature on
                   generating probabilistic forecasts subject to linear
                   constraints is somewhat limited. Available methods follow a
                   two-step procedure. Firstly, it draws future sample paths
                   from the univariate models fitted to each series in the
                   collection (which are incoherent). Secondly, it uses a
                   projection matrix based approach or empirical copula based
                   reordering approach to account for contemporaneous
                   correlations and linear constraints. The projection matrices
                   are estimated either by optimizing a scoring rule such as
                   energy or variogram score, or simply using a projection
                   matrix derived for point forecast reconciliation. This paper
                   proves that (a) if the incoherent predictive distribution is
                   Gaussian then MinT minimizes the logarithmic scoring rule;

  abstract      = "Hierarchical forecasting methods have been widely used to
                   support aligned decision-making by providing coherent
                   forecasts at different aggregation levels. Traditional
                   hierarchical forecasting approaches, such as the bottom-up
                   and top-down methods, focus on a particular aggregation level
                   to anchor the forecasts. During the past decades, these have
                   been replaced by a variety of linear combination approaches
                   that exploit information from the complete hierarchy to
                   produce more accurate forecasts. However, the performance of
                   these combination methods depends on the particularities of
                   the examined series and their relationships. This paper
                   proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on
                   machine learning that deals with these limitations in three
                   important ways. First, the proposed method allows for a
                   non-linear combination of the base forecasts, thus being more
                   general than the linear approaches. Second, it structurally
                   combines the objectives of improved post-sample empirical
                   forecasting accuracy and coherence. Finally, due to its
                   non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base
                   forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring
                   that the complete information must be used for producing
                   reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed
                   method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using
                   two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail
                   industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method
                   gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches,
                   especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not
                   characterized by the same patterns.",

                   with linear aggregation constraints has evolved substantially

                   (generalized least squares), OLS (ordinary least squares),
                   WLS (weighted least squares), and MinT (minimum trace). GLS
                   and MinT have similar mathematical expressions, but they

               different frequencies, or even generalised beyond aggregation as
               time series that respect linear constraints. When forecasting
               such time series, a desirable condition is for forecasts to be
               coherent: to respect the constraints. The past decades have seen
               substantial growth in this field with the development of
               reconciliation methods that ensure coherent forecasts and improve
               forecast accuracy. This paper serves as a comprehensive review of
               forecast reconciliation and an entry point for researchers and
               practitioners dealing with hierarchical time series. The scope of

                   effects models, give arise a certain type of covariance
                   structures that is a summation of low rank and sparse
                   matrices. This paper introduces a penalized approximation
                   framework to recover such model structures from large
                   covariance matrix estimation. We propose an estimator based
                   on minimizing a non-likelihood loss with separable non-smooth
                   penalty functions. This estimator is shown to recover exactly
                   the rank and sparsity patterns of these two components, and
                   thus partially recovers the model structures. Convergence
                   rates under various matrix norms are also presented. To
                   compute this estimator, we further develop a first-order
                   iterative algorithm to solve a convex optimization problem
                   that contains separa- ble non-smooth functions, and the
                   algorithm is shown to produce a solution within
                   O(1/t\textasciicircum2) of the optimal, after any finite t

               covariance with a conditional sparsity structure and
               fast-diverging eigenvalues. By assuming sparse error covariance
               matrix in an approximate factor model, we allow for the presence
               of some cross-sectional correlation even after taking out common
               but unobservable factors. We introduce the Principal Orthogonal
               complEment Thresholding (POET) method to explore such an
               approximate factor structure with sparsity. The POET estimator
               includes the sample covariance matrix, the factor-based
               covariance matrix (Fan, Fan, and Lv, 2008), the thresholding
               estimator (Bickel and Levina, 2008) and the adaptive thresholding
               estimator (Cai and Liu, 2011) as specific examples. We provide
               mathematical insights when the factor analysis is approximately
               the same as the principal component analysis for high-dimensional
               data. The rates of convergence of the sparse residual covariance
               matrix and the conditional sparse covariance matrix are studied
               under various norms. It is shown that the impact of estimating
               the unknown factors vanishes as the dimensionality increases. The
               uniform rates of convergence for the unobserved factors and their
               factor loadings are derived. The asymptotic results are also
               verified by extensive simulation studies. Finally, a real data

               ill-suited for this purpose. As statistically efficient and

               and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to
               the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks.
