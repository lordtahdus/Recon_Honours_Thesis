               arbitrary multifactor structure. For NYSE and AMEX stock returns
               from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with

               other features. We call these “hierarchical time series”. They

               forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than
               forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach.
               Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at
               all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to
               optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting
               revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are
               unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination
               forecasts under some simple assumptions.We show in a simulation

                   with linear aggregation constraints has evolved substantially
                   over the last decade. A few commonly used methods are GLS
                   (generalized least squares), OLS (ordinary least squares),
                   WLS (weighted least squares), and MinT (minimum trace). GLS
                   and MinT have similar mathematical expressions, but they
                   differ by the covariance matrix used. OLS and WLS can be
                   considered as special cases of MinT where they differ by the
                   assumptions made about the structure of the covariance
                   matrix. All these methods ensure that the reconciled
                   forecasts are unbiased, provided that the base forecasts are
                   unbiased. The ERM (empirical risk minimizer) approach was
                   proposed to relax the assumption of unbiasedness. This paper
                   proves that (a) GLS and MinT reduce to the same solution; (b)
                   on average, a method similar to ERM (which we refer to as
                   MinT-U) can produce better forecasts than MinT (lowest total
                   mean squared error) which is then followed by OLS and then by
                   base; and (c) the mean squared error of each series in the
                   structure for MinT-U is smaller than that for MinT which is
                   then followed by that for either OLS or base forecasts. We
                   show these theoretical results using a set of simulation
                   studies. We also evaluate them using the Australian domestic
